It incorporates two phases: The first, or acute phase combines Manual Lymph Drainage (MLD), multi-layer compression bandaging, meticulous skin care, and exercise to decongest the affected area and reduce fluid volume. The second, or maintenance phase transitions management of the condition to a long-term compression garment. Dr. West will guide you through both phases of treatment until you are independent and comfortable with managing your condition on your own.</p>
